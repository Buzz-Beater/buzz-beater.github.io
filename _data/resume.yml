  summary: >
    Hi! I'm Baoxiong, a research scientist at BIGAI. I received my Ph.D in the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles.
    My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with a special focus on 
    spatial/temporal reasoning and its application to acting and planning in real world (scene/activity understanding, future prediction, grounded manipulation, etc.).



    Previously, I obtained my M.S. from UCLA in 2019 and B.S. from Peking University in 2018.

  # I'm currently working at [VCLA@UCLA](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) advised by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). 
  # Before coming to LA, I got my B.S. in Computer Science from EECS, Peking University in 2018 after spending two wonderful years in the PKU Operating System Lab advised by [Prof. Yao Guo](http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~yaoguo). 
  # Prior to my Ph.D. study,  I joined the PKU-UCLA Joint Research Institute ([PKU-UCLA JRI](https://pku-jri.ucla.edu/jri/article/150479)) 3+2 Program,
  # and obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at UCLA in 2019 under the supervision of [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).
  # My research interest lies in the intersection of computer vision, artificial intelligence and cognitive science, 
  # with an special focus on spatial-temporal learning/reasoning 
  # and its application to understanding and planning tasks in both real world (scene/activity understanding, future prediction, etc.) and abstracted domains (Atari, RAVEN, etc.).
